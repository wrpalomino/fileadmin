Interlock Condition on your licence<br/><br/>
You've got your licence back, but the Magistrate has ordered you drive with an Interlock 
condition. What follows is a summary of issues relating to driving with an interlock condition, 
including some information about how you go about removing the your interlock after you have 
completed the mandatory minimum period ordered by the Magistate.<br/><br/>
How will having an interlock impact on me?<br/><br/>
You are on a BAC of 0.00% for the duration of the interlock period. You must only drive a motor 
vehicle fitted with an interlock device. No one except you is permitted to drive your motor 
vehicle so long as the interlock device is fitted. It is an offence to drive a motor vehicle in 
breach of your interlock condition.<br/><br/>
How much will the interlock device cost?<br/><br/>
There is an installation and removal fee, you are also responsible for the ongoing monthly service 
and maintenance of the interlock device. Expect to pay around $130 a month.<br/><br/>
How do I apply to remove the Interlock after the minimum period has expired?<br/><br/>
About 6 weeks before the end of the minimum interlock period, contact an accredited drink driver 
education agency for your final assessment and report. The assessment will take place after the 
interlock period has ended. You need to contact the company that installed and services your 
interlock, and provide that company with the name of the drink driver education agency and the 
date for your final assessment. You will need to consent to the release of information from your 
interlock supplier to the agency conducting your final assessment. After booking your final 
assessment and contacting your interlock supplier, you should attend Court and sign your 
application for removal of interlock condition. Your hearing will take place 28 days after lodging 
your application, and at least 7 days after you have completed your final assessment. The 
Magistrates Court will notify the police, and a police officer will interview you before your 
application is heard at Court.<br/><br/>
What happens at my court hearing?<br/><br/>
The Magistrate will consider your final assessment, and the data provided by your Interlock 
supplier. Your interlock supplier will have provided a report which lists the number of times the 
Interlock has been used to start your car. The report discloses occasions when the engine did not 
start due to a BAC over 0.00%. A Magistrate will be reluctant to grant the removal of an interlock 
condition where multiple failures are listed.<br/>
After a successful application for removal of Interlock Condition attend the nearest VicRoads 
office, bring your driver's licence, and bring the Interlock Removal Order.<br/><br/>
Do I need a lawyer?<br/><br/>
Having a lawyer there ensures that your case is put forward in the best possible light.<br/>
You have the comfort of knowing our firm has considerable experience in this technical field of 
licence restorations, and a well established history of helping our clients minimise their 
penalties and suspensions.<br/><br/>
Contact us closer to the end of your interlock period if you want us to represent you on the 
licence restoration hearing and we will guide you through the process."
