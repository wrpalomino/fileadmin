It's over. You've been to Court and you are off the road for some time. But what next?<br/>
What steps do you need to take? Will you have to have a breathalyser (interlock) installed on your 
car when you get your licence back?<br/>
The law governing these questions is technical and complex, and the statutory requirements depend 
upon many factors including, the date of the offence, whether it's your first or subsequent offence, 
whether you held a probationary or full driver's licence, the date of a previous court disqualification, 
and your age.
<p class='subtitle'>How do I get my license back?</p>
As a general guide where the offence date (for 1st offences and multiple offence) or the previous
disqualification period (for an earlier offence) is after the 13th May 2002, the steps to take are 
as follows:
<ol>
<li>At least 28 days before the disqualification period end, attend the closest Magistratesâ€™ Court
to you and complete the court form to apply to be re-licenced.<br/>
You will need to pay a fee of around $76 to lodge your application. You will be provided with a date 
for your Court hearing.<br/>
The police will also receive a copy of your application and will contact you for an interview before
your court hearing.</li>
<li>You then need to complete two tasks before your court hearing.<br/>
First, complete a drink driver education course provided by an Accredited Agency. Second, undertake 
a License Restoration Assessment, also provided by an Accredited Agency.<br/>
The Agency will provide the Court a report for the purpose of your hearing. The Magistrate hearing 
your application will read this report.</li>
<li>Attend Court for your application to be re-licenced. You can expect that the Magistrate and or
police prosecutor will test your knowledge of preventative drink driving measures and techniques you 
have learnt through your participation in the courses outlined above.</li>
</ol>
<p class='subtitle'>If I'm successful will an Interlock device be imposed as a condition?</p>
Upon a successful application the Magistrate will impose a condition that you be under a zero BAC 
limit. Depending on your circumstances, the Magistrate may also impose an Interlock condition. An 
interlock device is a breathalyser fixed to your car which prevents the engine starting if the device 
records a BAC reading greater than 0%. If you are 26 or over and it is your 1st offence and your BAC 
is 0.07-0.149%, the Court has a discretion not to impose an interlock condition. If the Magistrate 
decides to impose an interlock, the minimum period is 6 months. The same discretion exists for a 1st 
offence where the BAC reading is 0.15% and over and the disqualification occurred before 11th October 
2006. If the offence occurred after 11th October 2006 or was a Refusal offence or DUI offence a 
mandatory minimum period of 6 months applies.<br/><br/>
If you are under 26, or on a probationary license and it is a 1st offence and your BAC reading is
between 0.07% - 0.149% the Court must impose a minimum period of 6 months. For a second offence 
(within 10 years) and the date of disqualification is between 14.05.2002 and 10.10.2006, the Court 
must where the last offence was a BAC under 0.15% impose a minimum of 6 months. If the last offence 
was over 0.15% then a period of 3 years applies.<br/><br/>
For a 2nd offence within the last 10 years and the 2nd offence was committed on or after the 11th
October 2006, the Court must where last offence was a BAC under 0.15% impose a minimum of 12 months. 
If the last offence was a BAC of over 0.15% (or a Refusal offence or DUI) a minimum period of 4 years 
applies. For all 3rd and subsequent offences where the date of the last disqualification is after 13th 
May 2002 a minimum 3 years applies. Discretionary if disqualification on or before 13th May 2002. Where 
last offence committed on or after 11th October 2006 a minimum of 4 years applies.<br/><br/>
If you are charged with a non BAC offence (driving under the influence, refusing to provide a 
breath/blood sample, failing to stop at a preliminary breath testing station), an interlock device
condition is mandatory upon re-licencing.
<p class='subtitle'>Should I use a lawyer for my application?</p>
A successful application depends not only on whether you have met all the requirements described above, 
but also how persuasive you are in arguing to the Magistrate that they should not exceed the minimum 
penalty, or where a discretion exists, it should be exercised in your favour. Having a lawyer there 
ensures that your case is put forward in the best possible light.<br/><br/>
