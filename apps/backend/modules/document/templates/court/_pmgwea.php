    <ol>
      <li>
        Unless the Court directs otherwise, you may, if you wish, be present in Court at the hearing of your 
        application, or attend by audio visual link if that is practicable. If you wish to do either of these 
        things you should complete paragraphs 10 and 11 accordingly or otherwise notify the Registrar in 
        writing of your wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Court of Appeal will, if you wish, consider your case and your argument in writing. If you wish 
        to present your case in writing instead of orally, set out fully your case and argument and cause the 
        same to be delivered to the Registrar not less than seven days before the hearing.
      </li>
      <li>The Court of Appeal may treat the hearing of this application as the hearing of the appeal.</li>
      <li>
        You should be aware that the Court of Appeal has the power under section 568 of the Crimes Act 1958 
        if it quashes the sentence passed below and substitutes a different sentence, to impose a sentence 
        which is more or less severe than the sentence which is quashed.
      </li>
      <li>
        An application for leave against conviction may be abandoned not less than three days before the day 
        fixed for the hearing of the application by filing with the Registrar a notice of abandonment in the 
        appropriate form.
