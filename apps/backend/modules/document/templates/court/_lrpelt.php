  $helper->post_text = "<p class='subtitle'>Your License Restoration Hearing</p>
You now need to take action now to prepare for your licence restoration hearing.
<p class='subtitle'>What do I do?</p>
You need to apply for your licence at least 28 days before your disqualification period ends. 
You should contact our office soon to organize representation for the Court hearing and to discuss 
your application with us.
<p class='subtitle'>Which Court do I attend to lodge my application for license restoration?</p>
Attend the Magistrates’ Court closest to you. Before attending Court however you should contact 
an accredited Drink Driving Education Agency, to book in for a drink drivers education course, and 
a licence restoration assessment.<br/>
You may need to provide these dates to the Court when you book your hearing. The Court will fix a 
date for your hearing. The Court will charge around $80 when you lodge the application.<br/>
A copy of your application is also provided to the police. The police will contact you for an 
interview before the date of your court hearing.
<p class='subtitle'>What will I be required to do before my court hearing?</p>
Attend a Drink Drivers Education Course at an Accredited Agency. Then complete a Licence Restoration 
Assessment. The Agency will provide both courses, about 1-2 weeks apart. The Agency will provide the 
court with a report. The Magistrate will read and consider the contents of the report in assessing 
whether to grant your application.
<p class='subtitle'>What can I expect at the hearing and should I use a lawyer?</p>
A Magistrate determines whether or not you drive again. It is not automatic and every day you will 
attend a Magistrates’ Court where these applications are being refused or adjourned for lengthy 
periods.<br/>
Considerations extend to whether granting the application is in the interests of the broader 
community. Magistrates expect that a person who seeks to have their license back demonstrate their 
need to be re-licenced . This often involves persuading the Magistrate that your approach and attitude 
to drinking and driving has changed from the date of the offence and the ensuing disqualification 
period. For this reason you can expect that both the prosecutor and Magistrate will ask a number of 
probing questions aimed at testing your understanding of the techniques you have learnt to avoid drink
driving.<br/>
Preparation is the key to these hearings. When we represent people we take them through the questions 
we will ask them and the potential questions the other people will ask them We will take the time to 
ensure you are well prepared for your hearing. We will ensure that you convey all the important 
aspects of your application confidently and persuasively to the Magistrate.<br/><br/>
Please call and book an appointment so that we can get started Yours faithfully on your matter.";
