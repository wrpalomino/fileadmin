      Criminal Appeals: Requests for extension of time to<br/> file FSOG or outlines of submissions
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        All requests must be in writing to <?php echo $form['field2']->renderRow()?> identifying in the 
        subject line the name of the appeal. that it is an extension request. whether the appeal is listed 
        and if so. when, and providing the following infomiation: 
        <ul class="compact">
          <li>file number</li>
          <li>due date for the filing of the document</li>
          <li>extension sought</li>
          <li>reason for the extension</li>
          <li>
            reason for any urgency-in particular whether the appeal is currently listed or the appellant 
            has an earliest expected release date within 6 months.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Requests will not be considered unless it is apparent on the face of the request that the other 
        party has been copied in
      </li>
      <li>Requests for extension of time to file documents must be made before the time has expired.</li>
      <li>
        A request must be made even if the reason for failure to file is delay in the delivery of the 
        transcript. This is a sufficient reason for the first request. Unless the appeal is urgent or 
        listed the usual extension will be one month to file the full statement of grounds (FSOC) after 
        the electronic transcript is forwarded to the appellant.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you make a second or further request then you must provide satisfactory explanation for the 
        delay.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the event that the explanation is not considered satisfactory, the request may be refused, 
        granted for a limited time only or granted on the basis that it is the last extension. If a 
        request by an appellant is refused. the appeal will be deemed dismissed and a reinstatement 
        application required.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the interests of limiting repeated requests for extension, please ensure that any request 
        for extension once transcript has been received proposes a realistic but not unduly lengthy 
        time for filing and service of the document. Multiple repeated requests may be considered 
        evidence of insufficient proper attention to the appeal and lead to refusal of the request.
      </li>
