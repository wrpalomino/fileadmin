    $helper->content_text = "<p class='important'>More detailed Guideline to writing a character reference 
    letter for Court</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>The character reference for Court should be addressed 'To the Sentencing 
        Magistrate' or 'To the Sentencing Judge'</p>
        Who the character reference is addressed to depends on which Court the defendant is going to. 
        If the matter is in Victoria in the Magistrates' Court the character reference should be headed 
        'To the Sentencing Magistrate'. if it is in the County Court it should be headed 'To the Sentencing 
        Judge'. It is important to address a character reference correctly. It tells the Magistrate or 
        Judge that you know that it is not just a general character reference and is aimed specifically at 
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Show that you know what charges the Defendant is pleading guilty to.</p>
        This does not have to be the specific charges written out. It can be a general statement such 
        as 'I know John Smith is pleading guilty to drink driving' or 'theft charges' or whatever it may 
        be. The Judge then knows that you know what the reference is for. There is no point turning up 
        with a character reference that does not do this. The Judge will just say 'what's this worth if 
        they don't know John has been drink driving again?'
        <p class='subtitle'>a. If the Defendant is pleading guilty to assault charges.</p>
        A general statement such as 'I know John Smith is pleading guilty to assault charges' or 'hurting 
        someone' or whatever it may be will show the Judge that you know what the reference is for. It is 
        important with assault charges to give some indication of whether they are generally a violent 
        person or whether this is a one off incident.
        <p class='subtitle'>b. If the Defendant is pleading guilty to drink driving charges.</p>
        A general statement such as 'I know John Smith is pleading guilty to drink driving charges' or 
        'driving under the influence' or whatever it may be will show the Judge that you know what the 
        reference is for. It is important with drink driving charges to give some indication of whether 
        you know that they have been drinking less since they were caught and whether they have told you 
        that they know that drinking and driving was a stupid and dangerous thing to do.
        <p class='subtitle'>c. If the Defendant is pleading guilty to drugs charges.</p>
        A general statement such as 'I know John Smith is pleading guilty to possessing marijuana' or 
        'drugs charges ' or whatever it may be will show the Judge that you know what the reference is for.
        It is important with drug charges to give some indication of whether you know that they have been 
        trying to stop using drugs or whether it was a one off situation. Most Courts place a lot of emphasis 
        on people trying to rehabilitate. That is the Court wants to know that the person is trying their 
        best to do the right thing and not commit any further offences.
        <p class='subtitle'>d. If the Defendant is pleading guilty to dishonesty charges.</p>
        A general statement such as 'I know John Smith is pleading guilty to theft of a mobile phone' or 
        'stealing charges ' or whatever it may be will show the Judge that you know what the reference is 
        for. It is important with dishonesty charges to give some indication of whether you know that they 
        have had financial difficulties and that has been the reason they were stealing. It is also very 
        important if you can indicate that you know they have paid back the value or the money that they 
        have taken. That the defendant has told you they are very sorry for what they have done is very 
        important as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Find out if the person has been in trouble for this offence before.</p>
        There is no point giving us a character reference for Court that says this is 'out of character' 
        if they have done it before. We would not use a character reference like this as it would be dismissed 
        as worthless. Be careful discussing the facts of the case in detail unless you have seen the summary 
        of facts being read to the Judge.
        <p class='subtitle'>a. If the person has not been in trouble before this offence.</p>
        It is a very important feature of a case if a person has not been in trouble before. A civilian 
        should be able to rely on their good character to get a better outcome from the Court. You should 
        be emphasising that they have never been in trouble before and that they have always lead a very 
        positive lifestyle. That they are generally well regarded in the community is important as well 
        i.e. “John is well known and much liked by everyone at the cricket club”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>How long you have known the person.</p>
        This is a useful thing to put in a reference as it shows that they have known you long enough to 
        see a change in you. eg 'I have known John since he was 15 and first started mowing my lawns. He 
        has been through a tough time and I have seen him mature greatly over the last 6 months'<br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Include detail in the character reference.</p>
        It is very important to explain in detail about the person you are writing the character reference 
        for. An example of this is that a person might say 'I have known John for 2 years and is a kind 
        person.' Or much better they might say 'I have known John for 2 years since he first started helping 
        my disabled son who is his neighbour. He constantly helps my son out in many ways and so I have had 
        regular contact with him. He is very generous with his time and I am proud to say I know him as he 
        is one of the kindest people I have met'. Remember the Judge does not know the defendant and they 
        rely on the lawyers and documents such as character references to explain who they are.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>How you came to meet them.</p>
        Again this is information that is useful in assessing how much weight to give to a character 
        reference. You should always be completely truthful in character references. There is nothing worse 
        for a person than to hand up a character reference and it be shown to be untruthful.
        <p class='subtitle'>a. Relationship with the accused - Family member</p>
        Being a family member is an important perspective of a person. “I have known John since he was a 
        baby and he was always a happy child. I saw the troubles that he started having when he was a 
        teenager and he became isolated from his family”. It is also important to indicate whether you will 
        be giving him ongoing support “We love John and we will provide him with whatever help we can.”
        <p class='subtitle'>b. Relationship with the accused - Employer</p>
        A person being employed and having ongoing work is very important to the Court. As an employer you 
        should say how long you have employed the person for and what their job is. You should indicate 
        whether you can keep employing them if they lose their licence or if appropriate to the case they 
        have to go to prison for a short time . It is very important that your reference is on letterhead. 
        Also describe some of their attributes. Are they hardworking? Do they help their fellow employees? 
        etc. Being an employer is an extremely important reference and perspective of a person.
        <p class='subtitle'>c. Relationship with the accused - Friend</p>
        Being a friend is important as it indicates a good familiarity with a person. “I have known John 
        for 10 years since we meet playing football together. He has always been a kind friend and has made 
        an effort to help me whenever i have had problems.” Give information about them that shows that you 
        know them and are their friend. Good character references grab the attention of the Judge.
        <p class='subtitle'>d. Relationship with the accused – Other</p>
        It is important to explain what your relationship to the accused is. If you have just meet them say 
        so. If you have known them a long time but are not their friend then explain why you are writing a 
        reference on their behalf. This is information that is useful in assessing how much weight to give 
        to a character reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Your opinion of the defendant's personality.</p>
        What do you truly think of the defendant? What qualities do they have that you would want to tell 
        the Judge about if you were having a conversation with him.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Any positive things that you can say about their behaviour, activities etc.</p>
        Do they do any voluntary work? Do they help look after sick people? Are they the coach of the junior 
        footy team? A character reference for Court is all about giving a context to a persons life. Everyone 
        has some good qualities. It is important to explain them to the Judge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Is it is a driving charge and they will lose their job if they lose their licence?</p>
        Make sure you mention that! Especially if you are their employer. Be frank and tell it like it is. 
        'Time's are tough at our work and if John does not have his licence then we will try to keep him 
        but it is very likely we will have to let him go.' A character reference is often useful when it 
        spells out what consequences (outside of Court) are going to occur to the defendant. 'He will not 
        be able to drive his kid's to the soccer games on the weekend and as I work I can not do it either.' 
        The main penalties people have from losing their licence are personal. It is very hard for most 
        drivers to lose their licence. Spell that out to the Judge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Anything else they think is relevant.</p>
        Again this is your chance to say something positive about the defendant. If you write it and give 
        it to the lawyers early then they will have time to ask you to change it if what you are saying would 
        not help or is awkwardly drafted . An example being you might be focusing on their sickness whereas 
        the lawyer wants you to focus on their attempts to get work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Be signed and dated.</p>
        It is important that it is signed and dated so that the Judge can know that it was prepared for 
        this case. Also you can put a contact phone number on the reference. This gives the lawyer the ability 
        to say to the Prosecutor 'Give them a ring and check what they have written if you want'
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Get the character references to the lawyer early.</p>
        It is always useful to get references to the lawyer well before Court as it may alert them to useful 
        information about their client. They serve an important purpose as they can often convey what a 
        person is like to a Court in a way a lawyer can not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>How many character references should you get?</p>
        There is no magic number of character references that you should get. The more character references 
        that you get generally the better. Your lawyer can always just choose the ones they want to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>Do not suggest what penalty they should get.</p>
        Don't fall into the trap of saying what penalty they should get. Judges get annoyed by people who 
        do not know all the details of the case or the rules of sentencing telling them what to do. Just 
        say the positives about the defendant in the character reference and leave it to the lawyer to make 
        the submission on sentencing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>If you have any questions about what you are writing in the character reference 
        ring their lawyer.</p>
        They should be willing to answer your questions as your reference is helping their client.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class='subtitle'>If you can put the character reference on letterhead do so.</p>
        It is much better to have a character reference that is on letterhead from a business. It shows 
        that the person who is giving the character reference is employed and can give weight to what they 
        are writing.
